Because CompCert is big, and because of licensing concerns,
I've decided not to put CompCert into the git repo (yet).
For now, do this instead:

- Download a source distribution of CompCert from
  http://compcert.inria.fr/download.html
  (I used 2.4, the newest version at time of writing)

- Make sure you have Menhir installed, as compcert needs it
  (the version in the Ubuntu repos is fine;
  apt-get install menhir libmenhir-ocaml-dev
  was enough for me)

- Untar compcert, then run
  ln -s ./compcert-<vnum> ./compcert
  cd compcert
  ./configure ia32-linux
  make -j[number]
  make -j[number] clightgen

- (For the configure step, above, the platform doesn't really matter since
  we aren't going to be using compcert's platform-specific backends anyway;
  use ia32-linux if you're running Linux)
  (Also, since CompCert is big you want to use the -j flag to make
  to allow it to use multiple cores; I've heard
  -j[number of cores in your system minus one]
  is a reasonable heuristic)

- Now you should be able to build our code for C compilation!
