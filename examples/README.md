This directory contains our Sys abstraction as well as all of the examples that we have built using our Sys abstraction.

- System.v - contains our Sys abstraction and associated proof rules
- Velocity.v - velocity (first derivative) monitor
- Position.v - position (second derivative) monitor
- Interval.v - interval monitor
- Rectangle.v - two dimensional, vertical bounding rectangle with small-angle constraint
- Cuboid.v - monitor enforcing 3D cuboid bounds
- FourCuboids.v - a disjunction of 4 cuboids
- Quadcopter.v - the full quadcopter dynamics, with the small-angle constraint
